## Occasional Professional Service
### ClearFake Malware
*May, 2024*

A nearby company's blog was compromised by the **ClearFake** malware, and the owner's laptop executed malicious code via PowerShell. In response, I removed the malware from their WordPress site, re-established web service and deleted the suspicious files. The laptop was thoroughly cleaned, and all of the client's passwords were changed to prevent future unauthorized access.
