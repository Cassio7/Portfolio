## Occasional Professional Service
### ClearFake Malware
*May, 2024*

A nearby company's blog was compromised by the **ClearFake** malware, and the owner's laptop executed malicious code via PowerShell. In response, I removed the malware from their WordPress site by restoring it from previous backups and deleting suspicious files. The laptop was thoroughly cleaned, and all of the client's passwords were changed to prevent future unauthorized access.
