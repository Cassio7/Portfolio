## Trannoi

For the realization of this project, I was inspired by the game **Among Us**, taking the features that made the game famous but adapting it to a command-line interface.
It's played in turns on the same device, clearly without peeking &#x1F609;.
The goal for the astronauts is to complete tasks, while the impostors must eliminate the crew. Who will win?

**Technology:**
- C
