I am Alessio Cassieri, a passionate web application and software programmer, with a growing interest in cybersecurity, based in Perugia, Italy.
I have been fascinated by information technology and new technologies for 10 years now, so I always try to keep up with the progress, studying and informing myself about the changes in this amazing world.

I created this web portfolio, with a very minimalistic style because I love simplicity and cleanliness in code, to share my work, projects and work experiences.
